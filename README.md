# Hi, I'm Tomi Jacobs

I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate at the University of Illinois Chicago, studying the dynamics of computation and genetics — building bioinformatics pipelines by utilizing shell scripting, programming languages, and models to decode large-scale phylotranscriptomics data.

## Featured Projects

### Pythia Difficulty Score Analysis *(University of Illinois Chicago, Ph.D.)*
Applied the Pythia tool to evaluate per-dataset difficulty scores across phylogenetic clusters. The distribution of predicted difficulty scores was used to classify datasets as easy, intermediate, or difficult — informing downstream phylogenetic inference strategies.

### Conflict Analysis *(University of Illinois Chicago, Ph.D.)*
Phylogenetic conflict analysis examining the proportion of concordant, uninformative, and conflicting sites across the dataset. Each category reflects the degree of agreement between gene trees and the species tree.

### WGCNA for Sugar Maple Transcriptomics *(Cornell University, M.S.)*
Carried out bioinformatics research using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify key genes regulating drought resistance in *Acer saccharum* (Sugar Maple). Pipeline included DESeq2 differential expression analysis, variance stabilizing transformation, and co-expression network construction.

**MA Plot — Differential Gene Expression**
> Blue points represent statistically significant differentially expressed genes across drought treatment time points.

**Sample Correlation Heatmap (log2-transformed)**
> Hierarchical clustering of samples across control and drought treatment conditions (7, 14, and 21 days).

**Module Membership vs. Gene Significance**
> Strong negative correlation (r = -0.98, p < 1e-200) between module membership and gene significance for drought days, highlighting a highly relevant co-expression module.

### Phytosociological Survey of Weeds on a Date Palm Plantation *(University of Ilorin, B.S.)*
Conducted a field-based phytosociological survey to identify and characterize weed species compositions within a Date palm (*Phoenix dactylifera*) plantation. This undergraduate research laid the foundation for integrating botanical fieldwork with data analytics.
